# ART3
ART3 is my adaption of Stephen Grossberg's ART3-Adaptive Resonance Theory neural networks theory. I changed some of the terminology so I could extend the model and apply it to other cognitive phenomena.  I also designed a graphical interface to better track the data results of different simple input patterns and the outputs and network (LTM weights, etc) changes that from running the model.
Entirely written in LispWorks using CAPI as graphical interface. You can run it by downloading a free Personal version of Lispworks at lispworks.com (needed to run CAPI). Some files in MyUtilities are needed--refer to config files in ART3.
